# DKPace 3

### Setting up your project
#### 1.
Ensure you have all the project's dependencies installed. You will need Node.js and NW.js.

* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
* NW.js: http://nwjs.io/

Once Node.js is installed, from your terminal run the command:

<code>npm install -g bower</code>

This will install bower, the front-end package manager used by DKPace 3.

#### 2.
Clone the repo to your computer and open its directory with your terminal application. Run the command:

<code>bower install</code>

#### 3.
Extract the contents of your NW.js download to the project's working directory.

#### 4.
You should now be able to open nw.exe or nwjs.app and the application will launch.
